More to come as we get to work on this project.


**Building the main Qt4 code on Linux:**

`$ ./build.sh`

It will create the "xastir-qt" executable in the "build" directory.

Note: You may need to edit "build.sh" for OpenSuSE Linux. Change "qmake" to "qmake-qt5".


**Building the callpass executable on Linux:**

`$ cd callpass`

`$ ./build.sh`

It will create the "callpass" executable in the "build" directory. Go into the build directory and type "./callpass <callsign>" to get your passcode for Xastir.

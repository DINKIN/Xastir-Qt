More to come as we get to work on this project.


Building the main Qt4 code on Linux:

  $ ./build.sh

It will create the "xastir-qt" executable in the "build" directory.


Building the callpass executable on Linux:

  $ cd callpass
  $ ./bootstrap.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make

It will create the "callpass" executable in that directory. Use it by typing "callpass <callsign>" to get your passcode for Xastir.
